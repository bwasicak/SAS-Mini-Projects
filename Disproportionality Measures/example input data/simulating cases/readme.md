#Simulating Data for Spontaneous Adverse Events

##Background
When problems, adverse events, occur while taking a drug or using a medical device, they should be reported to the company that created them.  This is called a spontanous report.  Databases of the reports are mined to uncover potential issues where an event is potentially driven by the use of the drug or device.  Given that these databases only contain responses and are missing all the instances of no event with the drug or device, a different type of analysis is used to find abnormal combinations of drug/event.  These types of analysis are called disproportionality measures.  An overview of common ones of these and how to calculate them can be found in [Disproportionality Measures](../../.)
